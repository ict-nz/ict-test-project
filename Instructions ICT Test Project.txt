2. In the command line run -> npm install -g @angular/cli
4. In the command line navigate to the ICT-Test-Project folder.
5. In the command line run -> npm install
6. In the command line run -> ng serve (This will run the application)

8. You should not be looking at a blank page displaying "ict-test works!".
9. You are all set to start!

A basic Angular project has been set up. 
The root of the application is the app.component. 
This root component is displaying ict-test.component. 
The ict-test.component is injecting the ict-test.service. 
You will need to use the ict-test.service to make a Get request to display users in the ict-test.component.

For basic guidance on Angular see: https://angular.io/tutorial

Project Instructions:

1. In ict-test.service create a function to make a Get request to https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users.
   No authentication is required for this URL, the URL is already stored in the service. The request will
   return a list of 10 users with several properties. 
   (All the neccesary modules and components are already imported)

2. In ict-test.component consume the Get request function to get all the users on loading the component.

3. Using ict-test.component.ts and ict-test.component.html display each User on the page 
   including (name, username, city, website).

4. Add some styling to the page. You can import a library or make some custom CSS. 
   (Don't spend too long on this, just make it look a bit better)
